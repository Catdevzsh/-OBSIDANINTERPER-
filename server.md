## OBSIDANINTERPER Prompt
##
# Server Output for OBSIDANINTERPER

## Purpose
This document serves as the output for OBSIDANINTERPER, containing the translated code from the `client.md` instructions, ready for execution by GPT-4.

## Translated Code
- **Code Output:** Below is the translated code from the `client.md` instructions.

## Example
```python
# Example translated code
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    # Sentiment analysis logic
    sentiment_score = sentiment_analysis_function(text)
    return sentiment_score

input_text = "Your example text here."
print(analyze_sentiment(input_text))
  ## More
Execute the following code using GPT-4:
[Insert translated code here]

  
---

These templates provide a clear structure for inputting instructions in `client.md` and receiving the translated code in `server.md`. The OBSIDANINTERPER system should be able to interpret these instructions, convert them to code for GPT-4, and then output the results accordingly.
